**Mushroom Classification Challenge**


Welcome to the Mushroom Classification Challenge! This repository contains the solution for the Kaggle competition where the task is to classify mushrooms into two categories based on their features. The dataset is generated from a deep learning model trained on the UCI Mushroom dataset, with feature distributions close to but not exactly the same as the original.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset for this competition consists of the following files:

train.csv: The training dataset, where the target variable is class (binary, with values 'e' or 'p').

test.csv: The test dataset, where the objective is to predict the class for each row.

sample_submission.csv: A sample submission file in the correct format for submission.

 Dataset Characteristics
 
Feature Distributions: The features in the provided datasets are similar to but not identical to those in the original UCI Mushroom dataset.
Data Artifacts: Note that data artifacts have not been cleaned up. Some categorical values in the dataset are not present in the original dataset. Handling these artifacts is part of the challenge.
Project Overview
In this project, we aim to build a classification model that predicts the class of mushrooms based on the provided features. The following steps are included in the project:

Data Exploration: Analyze and understand the dataset, including feature distributions and potential data artifacts.
Data Preprocessing: Handle categorical values, deal with missing values, and prepare the dataset for modeling.
Model Building: Experiment with various classification algorithms to identify the best-performing model.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics and validate it on the test set.
Submission: Generate predictions for the test set and prepare the submission file in the required format.
